# Image-Processing-Hybrid-Image


Hybrid Image is a term used to refer to images that can be seen diffrently from short andlong distances. The following image is an example of a hybrid image. This picture looks like a bicycly from short distance while the same picture looks like a motorcycle from farther away (Get farther from the monitor). The goal of this project is to build such images using signal and image processing techniques in MATLAB.
